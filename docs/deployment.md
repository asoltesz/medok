# Deploying Medok

Medok doesn't yet have a Helm chart or similar more advanced deployment method.

Use the samples in the development/devmode folder and in this page.
 
It is recommended to install Medok into the same namespace as your Mailu installation.

Make sure you have installed External-DNS beforehand with:
 - the "crd" source activated
 - your DNS provider configured (e.g.: Cloudflare)

# RBAC

Edit rbac.yaml, ensuring that the "namespace" field values point to the namespace of the Mailu/Medok installation.

# The Medok deployment object

The sample assumes these:
- you installed your Mailu instance with Helm, with the release name "mailu" (in the pod selector: app=mailu...)
- you installed Mailu/Medok into the namespace "mailu"
- your mail domain is "example.com" and your mail server FQN is "mailu.example.com"

# Validating the installation

The successfully started Medok pod should create a "dnsendpoint" object for External-DNS.

~~~
kubectl get dnsendpoint -n mailu

kubectl describe dnsendpoint medok -n mailu
~~~

External-DNS should create the necessary DNS record in your DNS registry.
